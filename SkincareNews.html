            <h4><b>MEET AN ARCHITECT TURNED SKINCARE ENTREPRENEUR</b> </h4><br>
            <p>
        “Luxury in a budget is what we aim for”, said the budding women entrepreneur Ruchitha, CEO of Eudwiskin.<br>
        Eudwiskin is a two-month-old Banglore based skincare startup which is a new trendsetter in the skincare industry.  In an interaction with the Founder of Eudwiskin, Ruchitha shared her views on making skincare products in a more natural and in a sustainable way.<br><br>

<h4><b>WHAT IS EUDWISKIN</b> </h4><br>
Eduwiskin is derived from an Arabic word, which is an Organic Natural Skincare. “I thought a lot before naming my dream company and researched a lot about it. Finally, Eudwiskin is what I was looking for?”, Ruchitha said. ( You have to sound it as Audwiskin, she corrected me).<br><br>

<h4><b>WHEN WAS IT STARTED?</b></h4><br>

Eudwiskin was started in July 2020, “ It is a home startup, we made skincare products in small batches and initially started selling with friends, family and neighbours. Our products were loved by everyone and we started receiving positive feedback. So far we have sold 200 products and have 100 supportive customers and we are shipping all over India”, said the passionate 22-year-old.  
<br><br>


<h4><b>JOURNEY FROM ARCHITECT TO ENTREPRENEUR:</b></h4><br>

“I love researching things. I invest so much on buying skincare products and explore more about it. The more I read about it, the more I came to know its potential harmful ingredients added in it. That upsets me. I wanted a skincare product more natural, skin-friendly which is zero harmful. Then, I started looking for learning how to make skincare products, I learnt to do well and that is how Eudwiskin is born”, Ruchitha said. 
 
<br><br>



<h4><b>FAST SELLING PRODUCTS:</b>
</h4><br>
“We have over 25 products in Eudwiskin and a lot more waiting to launch. Our fast-moving products are Lipbalm and Coffee scrub. We have received more positive reviews and feedback about how customers love its aroma and goodness of the product and we continue to provide the same in the future. Luxury in a budget is what we aim for. We promise to give natural products in a pocket-friendly way” , said Eudwiskin founder. 
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FOUNDER INSPIRATIONS:</b>
</h4><br>


“My biggest inspiration is my mother. She is a beautician, I grew up watching my mother doing her DIY, that inspires me. We have introduced a lot of naturals clays and powders in our products especially we outsource all the natural powders like moringa, hibiscus and amla from our farm. Also, extra points to my father, he supports me in all the ways”, says Ruchitha and told she enjoys making all of the products and shipping it to the customers with a handwritten letter. 
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FUTURE PLANS:</b>
</h4><br>

“We have plans of taking our business to the next level and we are working towards it. Our mission is to provide an Indian made natural skincare product at an affordable price. We firmly stick towards our mission.”, said the Eudwiskin founder and we can’t agree more since we have used the products and totally loved it. Dear Skin wishes Eudwiskin to reach heights in the future. It is always a thumbs up when it comes to Eudwiskin products.
