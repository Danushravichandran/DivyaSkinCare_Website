            <h4><b>MEET AN GURGAON BASED HOMEMAKER TURNED HER PASSION INTO BUSINESS</b> </h4><br>
            <p>
        With only seven products, won hearts of more than 2000 people and on a mission to acquire many.  Meet the Gurgaon based homemaker turned her passion into a business.<br><br>
        Read the exclusive story about the Journey of Skinworks.<br><br>

        “All our products are 100% preservative-free”, gleamed Neha, Founder of Skinworks. <br><br>  

        Skinworks is a Gurgaon based skincare home startup, commenced during the pandemic April and stealing the hearts of many.  Within a moment, Skinworks draws immediate attention and sweeps everyone's eyes with the quality and the package of delivery. During the conversation with Neha Juneja, the founder of Skinworks, she shared her most exciting journey of Skinworks with so much love and enthusiasm.  
 
<br><br>

<h4><b>WHY SKINWORKS?
</b> </h4><br>
“Skinworks is the only name that came into my mind when I thought of starting a business related to skincare. I always believe that whatever the products I give should work on the skin, so I had not stressed a lot before thinking of what to name my brand. Skinworks products are the ones which truly work on your skin and that is my only vision”, stated Neha.<br><br>

<h4><b>WHEN WAS IT STARTED?</b></h4><br>

“Skinworks is started during this pandemic in April. I made a small batch and gave it to my friends and family. I loved curating all the products carefully, right from making, packing and delivering with hand written notes.  Within a few days, I received a lot of positive reviews for the product, which inspired me to concentrate more on my business. Skinworks had an organic reach of 2000 followers at the initial phase in Instagram within six months.”, said awe-inspiring Neha.  
<br><br>


<h4><b>WHAT IS THE IDEA BEHIND 100% PRESERVATIVE FREE PRODUCTS?
</b></h4><br>
“I wanted my products to be raw and the goodness of the rawness will work on everyone. I do not want to take out the raw goodness in the name of preservatives. Most importantly, all of my products are safe, natural, plant-based, can be used by anyone like unisex, even pregnant women and kids.”, said the boss women. 
 
<br><br>



<h4><b>FAST SELLING PRODUCTS:</b>
</h4><br>
“We have seven products and Orange Almond Face scrub is the fastest-selling product in Skinworks. Still, I remember my first positive review for the product that enthralled me. Most face packs used in the market makes our skin dry. But our face packs are not drying and renders the skin supple and moisturized.  Apart from that, we have a green tea face mask, coffee clay face mask, charcoal facemask, coffee and oats body scrub, beetroot lip scrub. Our recent launch, Magic melt cleansing balm is also a best seller and it can also be used as a face cleanser for kids. We also have combo kits according to skin types and concerns”, said the Skinworks founder.  
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FOUNDER INSPIRATIONS:</b>
</h4><br>

“It is my mother, Mrs.Archana Gupta is my soul inspiration. In my childhood, my mother used to make Orange Almond face scrub for me. Even as a kid and in my teenage, I trusted only my mother’s natural remedies more than any drug store products. When I look at the journey of Skinworks, it started from my mother and in one word, she is the mastermind and inspirational factor behind this.”, said the elegant Neha. 
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FUTURE PLANS:</b>
</h4><br>

“I am concentrating more on introducing new products. I have an upcoming plan of introducing Toners. Skinworks products are affordable by all, ranging from Rs.300 to Rs.1530. We are taking our business into the next level of branding. We also planned to launch Diwali gift hampers. So far, our products are loved by all. We will continue to provide the same quality and standard products that work on the skin and also to cherished by many.”, vowed Neha.

            <h4><b>MEET AN ARCHITECT TURNED SKINCARE ENTREPRENEUR</b> </h4><br>
            <p>
        “Luxury in a budget is what we aim for”, said the budding women entrepreneur Ruchitha, CEO of Eudwiskin.<br>
        Eudwiskin is a two-month-old Banglore based skincare startup which is a new trendsetter in the skincare industry.  In an interaction with the Founder of Eudwiskin, Ruchitha shared her views on making skincare products in a more natural and in a sustainable way.<br><br>

<h4><b>WHAT IS EUDWISKIN</b> </h4><br>
Eduwiskin is derived from an Arabic word, which is an Organic Natural Skincare. “I thought a lot before naming my dream company and researched a lot about it. Finally, Eudwiskin is what I was looking for?”, Ruchitha said. ( You have to sound it as Audwiskin, she corrected me).<br><br>

<h4><b>WHEN WAS IT STARTED?</b></h4><br>

Eudwiskin was started in July 2020, “ It is a home startup, we made skincare products in small batches and initially started selling with friends, family and neighbours. Our products were loved by everyone and we started receiving positive feedback. So far we have sold 200 products and have 100 supportive customers and we are shipping all over India”, said the passionate 22-year-old.  
<br><br>


<h4><b>JOURNEY FROM ARCHITECT TO ENTREPRENEUR:</b></h4><br>

“I love researching things. I invest so much on buying skincare products and explore more about it. The more I read about it, the more I came to know its potential harmful ingredients added in it. That upsets me. I wanted a skincare product more natural, skin-friendly which is zero harmful. Then, I started looking for learning how to make skincare products, I learnt to do well and that is how Eudwiskin is born”, Ruchitha said. 
 
<br><br>



<h4><b>FAST SELLING PRODUCTS:</b>
</h4><br>
“We have over 25 products in Eudwiskin and a lot more waiting to launch. Our fast-moving products are Lipbalm and Coffee scrub. We have received more positive reviews and feedback about how customers love its aroma and goodness of the product and we continue to provide the same in the future. Luxury in a budget is what we aim for. We promise to give natural products in a pocket-friendly way” , said Eudwiskin founder. 
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FOUNDER INSPIRATIONS:</b>
</h4><br>


“My biggest inspiration is my mother. She is a beautician, I grew up watching my mother doing her DIY, that inspires me. We have introduced a lot of naturals clays and powders in our products especially we outsource all the natural powders like moringa, hibiscus and amla from our farm. Also, extra points to my father, he supports me in all the ways”, says Ruchitha and told she enjoys making all of the products and shipping it to the customers with a handwritten letter. 
  
<br><br>



<h4><b>FUTURE PLANS:</b>
</h4><br>

“We have plans of taking our business to the next level and we are working towards it. Our mission is to provide an Indian made natural skincare product at an affordable price. We firmly stick towards our mission.”, said the Eudwiskin founder and we can’t agree more since we have used the products and totally loved it. Dear Skin wishes Eudwiskin to reach heights in the future. It is always a thumbs up when it comes to Eudwiskin products.
