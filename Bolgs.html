            <h4>My Skincare Journey</h4><br>
            <p>
             The phrase “Skincare is essential. Makeup is an choice”, brings out the conviction of having a healthy skincare leaving behind makeup is an second option. You don’t need to invest a lot of money for having a healthy skincare.<br><br>

Healthy skincare works like two sides of a coin.<br><br>

Tail Side Of a Coin
If you follow proper diet, then your skin is the happiest part of your body. An unhealthy diet can damage the happy layers of skin ending up in breakouts and dullness. To have a glowing skin, you need to:<br><br>

Drink at-least 8 glasses of water every day.<br><br>
Have seasonal fruits and vegetables.<br><br>
Have a detox drinks such as ABC or ABCD Juice.<br><br>
Avoid Junk Foods.<br><br>
Keep a eye on dairy intake.<br><br>
Be mindful of sugars in your diet.<br><br>
2. Head Side of a Coin<br><br>

Stick to the mantra of skincare routine. Your skin as the day goes, gets used to the routine you are providing to the skin.<br><br>

Your morning skincare routine should involve:<br><br>

Cleanser<br><br>
Toner<br><br>
Moisturiser<br><br>
Sunscreen ( or moisturiser with SPF)<br><br>
Nightcare routine involves:<br><br>

Cleanser<br><br>
Toner<br><br>
Serums<br><br>
Spot Treatments<br><br>
Moisturisers<br><br>
Sleeping Mask<br><br>
Exfoliation is necessary to remove the dead cells from your skin. Include gentle peels and scrubs in your skincare routine as 2-3 times per week.<br><br>

I am a firm believer that if you take care of your skin, you need not want a lot of makeup. Glowing skin is your ultimate makeup.<br><br>

So Skincare is essential, Makeup is a choice.<br><br>

Make good choices.

             MSME!<br> 
MSME!!<br><br>
MSME!!!<br> We are MSME registered! You can see ‘n’ number of home business profiles labelled under MSME registration.<br>

Wondering what is MSME all about?  It is Micro, Small and Medium Enterprises. It is not mandatory to register, but registering will help you opt for benefits from the government on low interest rates, incentives and exemptions. MSME known as Udyog Aadhar Registration from 2015. Udyog aadhar recently revamped their website and the old links will not work. Check the new link for registering here https://udyogaadhaar.gov.in/ 
So, if you are a homemade skincare seller, you need your benefits from the government and to register your brand you need to get a MSME certification.<br> 

STEPS:
While registering it will ask for your Name and Aadhar No. Fill in the details and it will take you to filling a form containing details of your company. Enter your company name, number of persons employed and business address and your bank details. You need to feed your bank details whereas the government will check for the annual income and calculate tax based on that. For a micro service like company it should not exceed > 25 lakh rupees. 
It will ask you to feed NIC code. There are 2digit, 4 digit and 6 digit NIC code available.<br>
So if you are a homemade skincare seller register at
NIC-20 Manufacture of chemicals and chemical products
Under the subcategory,
NIC- 2023- Manufacture of soap and detergents, cleaning and polishing preparations,
perfumes and toilet preparations.
And further in subcategory,
NIC- 20237
Manufacture of cosmetics and toiletries (includes manufacture of pre- shave, shaving or after shave preparations; personal deodorants and anti- respirants; perfumed bath salts and other bath preparations; beauty or make-up preparations and preparations for the care of the skin, other than medicaments; manicure and pedicure preparations etc.).
This will be your NIC code for homemade skincare selling. For further manufacturing refer https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Ilhql5zihh4gOrrTssoyPyH516u3W4lv/view page53.
After all the proofs, details are fed in the form and submitted, you will get a printable MSME certification with UAM ( Udyog Aadhaar Memorandum) number, for the identification of your business.<br>


Consider the above part alone for homemade skincare selling MSME registration. If your business is at the next level, you have to abide by the rules of FDA ( Food and drug Administration). You have to follow certain rules for making cosmetics at home. <br>
You should get a license from FDA to sell cosmetic, color additives, alcohol based perfumes and etc.
You should not sell adulterated products.<br>

And get your products licensed under ECOcert and COSMOS. If your product is COSMOS ( 95-100% ) of products should contain natural products.<br>
To get ECOCERT, ( 95- 100%) of the product should contain organic ones. You have to prepare a copy and write to ecocert.in to submit your form. There are numerous licenses available like ISO, vegan , cruelty free standards. <br>

Anyways for the homemade skincare selling too, you have to abide by the rules of FDA as you should not sell contaminated and adulterated products. For more details you can drop a text in my instagram, I’ll resolve the queries. <br>
Make skincare with love with care.<br>
