            <h4><b>Bad Alcohols and Good Alcohols in Skincare</b></h4><br>
            <p>
          Many of us think that all the alcohols in skin care products as an ingredient is not good for skin. But that is not true. There are many different types of alcohols which have different use cases with different effects. Some are perilous but some are safe for topical use. In most of the cases, skin itself shows whether it mesh well with the certain type of alcohol included product or not. There are some early signs which shows up and help you determine if your skin care product has bad or good alcohol ingredient. If you pick up a new skin cleanser product and see that any certain alcohol is its main constituent, it’s fair game to ponder this a red flag, and you’ll want to do some detailed exploration before investing in the product. Still, there’s no need to steer clear of all alcohols, all the time.<br><br>

To make any cream or product lighter, alcohols such as isopropyl alcohol, alcohol denat, methanol and ethanol. These alcohols also help other ingredients to penetrate and protect your skin. On the skin outer layer everything is “fine”. BUT there is a disadvantage. These alcohols might cause aridity, irritation and skin breakouts.
<br><br>

<span id="dots11">...</span><span id="more11">
Below given are the list of alcohols which are good and contain fatty alcohols. These alcohols are appropriate for dry skin, and mostly fine for any skin type. They do not dry or cause irritation in your skin. In fact, they have the differing effect. They act as moisturizers which shield your skin and aid it to keep moisturize.<br><br>
  • Stearyl or isostearyl alcohol<br>
  • C12-16<br>
  • Cetearyl alcohol<br>
  • Lauryl alcohol<br>
  • Isopropyl myristate<br>
  • Isopropyl palmitate<br>
  • Glyceryl stearate<br>
  • Glycol<br>
  • Myristyl Alcohol<br>
  • Cetyl alcohol<br><br>
  On the other hand, when bad alcohols are used in higher amount, they worsen your skin’s shielding barrier. This means your skin will not be effective in keeping moisture in it. If your skin produces too much oil, it also stimulates oil production which could lead to breakouts. Some bad alcohols are made of petroleum-based ingredients which are not good for your skin and are simply denatured alcohols. <br><br>
  These alcohols are not so skin friendly alcohols as they include isopropyl alcohol, ethanol, and alcohol denat. Some are used as preservers while some are used to get skin care formulations to the right consistencies. Some are used to assist liquid formulas which dries quickly on your skin and still others may be involved in toners and cleansers to help reduce excess sebum.<br><br>
  Someof the bad alcohols used in skincare products are <br>
• Denatured alcohol<br>
• Alcohol <br>
• Ethanol<br>
• Methanol<br>
• Isopropyl Alcohol<br><br>

            <h4><b>Extraction Methods</b></h4><br>
            <p>
          Natural ingredients are proven to be the best for all the problems since ancient years. They are considered as the vital source for product manufacturing. The amount of natural components in the manufactured products are very less. They just contain the essence and not the required amount of the ingredient. With this situation it is important to learn and understand selective and effective methods for the extraction and isolation of those bioactive natural products.<br><br>
The process of extracting natural product is straight forward, crush or grind it up and then add an appropriate solvent. After an appropriate time period, perhaps escorted by heat and/or agitation, we can then filter off the unsolvable solid, leaving us with the required extract of the ingredient.<br><br>

<span id="dots10">...</span><span id="more10">
In order to separate the desired natural ingredient from the raw material, extraction is considered as the initial. According to the extraction principle, this process includes solvent extraction, distillation method and sublimation.<br><br>

The extraction process undergoes the following stages:<br>
(1) the solvent penetrates in the solid matrix<br>
(2) the solute liquifies in the solvents<br>
(3) the solute is diffused<br>
(4) the extracted solutes are placid<br> <br>
The selection of the solvent is crucial for solvent extraction. Selectivity, solubility, cost and safety should be considered in selection of solvents. The solubility and  diffusivity can be enhanced by any factor will facilitate the extraction process. The extraction efficiency upsurges with the increase in extraction duration in a convinced time range.<br><br>
The extraction efficiency will be affected by the following things:<br>
  • the particle size of the raw materials,<br>
  • the solvent-to-solid ration<br>
  • the properties of the extraction solvent,<br>
  • the extraction temperature, and <br>
  • the extraction duration<br><br>
  One of the most popular method to isolate and extract is Steam Distillation. The methods help in separating essential oils from plants for use in natural products. When the steam vaporises the pants material and volatile compounds, then the process of Steam Distillation occurs. This eventually goes through a condensation and assortment process. <br> <br>
  Other method which is widely used is Solvent extraction. To isolate essential oils from plant material this method employs food grade solvents such as ethanol and hexane. It is best suitable for plant ingredients that produce low amounts of essential oil, which are chiefly viscous, or that are delicate aromatics incapable to bear the compression and distress of steam distillation. Solvent extraction method also produces a finer fragrance than any other type of distillation process.<br><br>
 <b> STEAM DISTILLATION</b><br>
We use steam distilled method to collect the evaporated particles. For example, essential oils, hydrosols. <br><br>

<b>OIL INFUSION</b><br>
We infused herbs or dry leaves in oil as macernated one to get its full properties<br>
Example : dry chamomile leaves infused in apricot kernal oil<br><br>

<b>POWDERED EXTRACTS</b><br>
All the leaves and herbs are dried and grind it to fine powder to use the extracts<br>

Example: Dried rose petals grinding in to fine powder.<br><br>

<b>GLYCERITE</b><br>

The fresh fruit, vegetable or herbs are infused in to alcohol for a month and using its glycerite in skincare formulation products.<br>

Example: Butterfly pea flower infused in glycerine for a month to obtain natural blue color to added in skincare formulation products.<br><br>

            <h4><b>Skin Facts</b></h4><br>
            <p>
            Skin due to sensation plays an important role in spotting cold and hot. It regulated the body temperature and is the major organ of the body. Skin guards’ bones, muscles, and other internal organs from external diseases and infections. This is just the initials and there is so much more than this about skin that you would be definitely interested in knowing. <br><br>

Here are some of the most interesting facts about your skin<br><br>

<span id="dots9">...</span><span id="more9">

  • The skin refuges an area of 2 square meters. <br>
  • 15% of your body weight is made up of the skin. <br>
  • The adult has around 21 square feet of skin, that weighs 9 lbs  and has more than 11 miles of blood vessels. <br>
  • A single square inch of skin has 19 million cells and up to 300 sweat glands. There are 300 million skin cells in a human body. <br>
  • Your skin is its thinnest on your eyelids (0.2mm) and thickest on your feet (1.4mm). <br>
  • The skin renews itself every 28 days. <br>
  • Your skin constantly sheds about 30,000 to 40,000 dead cells every minute!  <br>
  • Some sources estimate that more than half of the dust in your home is actually dead skin.  <br>
  • In the earth’s atmosphere, dead skin consists of a billion tons of dust. <br>
  • There are around 1000 species of bacteria which live on our skin. <br>
  • Skin heals itself by forming scar tissue which is completely different from normal skin tissue as it lacks sweat glands and hair. <br>
  • If exposed to frequent rubbing or pressure, skin can form additional thickness and toughness which is called a ‘callus’.  <br>
  • Some skin nerves are connected to the muscles through spina cord to response more quickly to pain and heat etc. <br>
  • There are around five different types of receptors which response to touch and pain. <br>
  • Skin change can indicate to overall health. <br>
  • Each inch of skin is made up of 20 blood vessels, and 1,000 nerve endings. <br> <br>

  These Skin Facts are just some of the thousands of vital aspects and its health. Sustaining a healthy skin is crucial to this task. More than a caring organ, your skin purposes as an immune organ. Specialized immune cells live in the skin and identifies obtrusive organisms and constituents. They respond to stimulate a fighter response or allergic response by employing particular white blood cells from blood vessels in the skin. <br>

            <h4><b>Skincare is essential Makeup is a choice</b></h4><br>
            <p>
             The phrase “Skincare is essential. Makeup is an choice”, brings out the conviction of having a healthy skincare leaving behind makeup is an second option. You don’t need to invest a lot of money for having a healthy skincare.<br><br>

Healthy skincare works like two sides of a coin.<br><br>

Tail Side Of a Coin
If you follow proper diet, then your skin is the happiest part of your body. An unhealthy diet can damage the happy layers of skin ending up in breakouts and dullness. To have a glowing skin, you need to:<br><br>

<span id="dots">...</span><span id="more">

Drink at-least 8 glasses of water every day.<br><br>
Have seasonal fruits and vegetables.<br><br>
Have a detox drinks such as ABC or ABCD Juice.<br><br>
Avoid Junk Foods.<br><br>
Keep a eye on dairy intake.<br><br>
Be mindful of sugars in your diet.<br><br>
2. Head Side of a Coin<br><br>

Stick to the mantra of skincare routine. Your skin as the day goes, gets used to the routine you are providing to the skin.<br><br>

Your morning skincare routine should involve:<br><br>

Cleanser<br><br>
Toner<br><br>
Moisturiser<br><br>
Sunscreen ( or moisturiser with SPF)<br><br>
Nightcare routine involves:<br><br>

Cleanser<br><br>
Toner<br><br>
Serums<br><br>
Spot Treatments<br><br>
Moisturisers<br><br>
Sleeping Mask<br><br>
Exfoliation is necessary to remove the dead cells from your skin. Include gentle peels and scrubs in your skincare routine as 2-3 times per week.<br><br>

I am a firm believer that if you take care of your skin, you need not want a lot of makeup. Glowing skin is your ultimate makeup.<br><br>

So Skincare is essential, Makeup is a choice.<br><br>

Make good choices.

            <h4><b>Ph Levels of skincare making</b></h4><br>
            <p>
              We have a tendency to concentrate on the fun traits such as smell, texture and smell. In this it is very likely that we forget the important step of maintain the skin’s Ph level. While making a choice of products for your skin and hair it is crucial that you focus on the correct Ph of the product along with the smell and texture. In the best scenario, lack of right Ph can make your product wont work on the skin and in the worst scenario it can damage your skin. How pH relates to our skin and the products we use is enthralling. And despite the worry, finding pH-balanced skin care is easier than you might contemplate. pH measurement is one of the most basic steps in forming a good skin, yet it could be quite intimidating<br><br>

<span id="dots3">...</span><span id="more3">

  The term “pH” refers to “potential of hydrogen”. In a water-based solution it apprehends the action of hydrogen ions where ions are particles that carry a positive or negative charge. Hydrogen is made up of two thirds of water. Water has two hydrogen molecules plus an oxygen molecule, H²o. The Ph can be measured from 0-14 in a numeric scale. Ph at 7 is consider as neutral. Anything below 7 is said to be acidic and above that is basic or alkaline. Lemon juice has a pH of 2 which is very acidic, while ammonia has a pH of 12, which is highly alkaline, also referred to as basic, as in acids and bases. <br><br>

  It is essential in product constancy, and most prominently, in natural cosmetics to have a maintained Ph value for the performance of the preservative system of the product you are using. It is not mandatory that the pH of the cosmetic products remain in a certain range to pledge consumers' safety. Skin has a shielding layer on its surface called the acid mantle. The acid mantle is made up of sebum expelled from the skin’s sebaceous glands. The sebum mixes with lactic and amino acids from sweat creating the skin’s pH, which ideally should be somewhere between 4.5 -5.5.  All skincare products should be tested to ensure they remain within this range. A good exercise is to test pH directly after manufacture of the product, and again in 30 days to make sure the pH hasn’t altered.  pH can be exaggerated by a variation of reasons with components, preservers, temperatures, and time.  <br> <br>
  According to the paulas Choice these should be the PH levels of skincare products,<br>
For Cleansers: pH 4.5–7<br>
For Toners: pH 5–7<br>
For Sunscreens: pH 5–7.5<br>
For Moisturizers and lotions: pH 5–7<br>
For Serums: pH 4–6<br>

            <h4><b>What is DM water used in cosmetic formulation?</b></h4><br>
            <p>
              Cosmetic formulation is the complicated process as it includes the product formation which are directly used by the customers. One should keep in mind which water to used in the formulation of cosmetics. All water cast-off in cosmetic formulations goes under the process of removing components that could interfere with a product’s firmness and performance. There are wide variety of water types like Distilled, deionized, purified or tap water etc. that can be used for formulating cosmetics. It is recommended to use DM or Demineralized water. It’s pretty much the same thing as deionized water. This water is sent through an ion exchange process.  Deionized water or demineralized water is the water that has its mineral ions removed. These ions may consist of cations from copper, iron, sodium, calcium, and anions like chloride and bromide. As a means of process of purification water is demineralized or deionized.  So, this makes it ideal to use in the manufacturing of cosmetics.
<br><br>

<span id="dots5">...</span><span id="more5">


  Demineralization can be performed with ion exchangers or other filtration system. But the main purpose of water purification is to soften the water by removing Calcium and Magnesium ions. The resulting demineralized water contains Sodium Chloride. The use of DM water in Cosmetics is commonplace. When cosmetics or skincare products are made, they need to be made using highly pure water to ensure that no pollutants, impurities or microbes are present in the final product.  This can be achieved with the use of Demineralized water.   <br><br>


  Dm water is made ideal to use in the manufacturing of the cosmetic products by removing many of its mineral ions. These mineral ions are eliminated by using specially manufactured ion exchange resins.  For instance, mineral content of water is measured in parts per million (ppm), with tap water typically having between 250 – 400 ppm and by contrast deionized water can be as low as 0-2 ppm. This makes DM water suitable and save to use them in Cosmetics Formulation which also good for skin and hairs. Dm water does not cause any harm to skin as this is made highly purified after the process of purification.<br><br>
Companies should not use plain tap water as this can affect the product’s stability and performance.  Tap water can also cause harm to skin unknowingly. The use of DM water can reduce the chances of the product being tainted by impurities found in general tap water.

            <h4><b>Sunscreen</b></h4><br>
            <p>
              A Sunscreen is a crucial part of every skincare routine for all the season whether rain or shine. It helps shield the skin from harmful ultraviolet(UV) rays. Sunscreen or sunblock is a gel, lotion, spray, foam stick or other topical product that absorbs or reflects some of the sun's UV radiation and thus helps protect against sunburn. The goal of any sunscreen is to help protect against UVA and UVB rays. It is essential for all skin types and ethnicities. 
<br><br>

<span id="dots6">...</span><span id="more6">


  Depending on the UV filter ingredients founds, Sunscreen work in two ways as a sun protection product. Sunscreen with chemical components like homosalate works by mixing well into the top layer of the skin and absorbing UV radiation before it can damage skin cells. Second way is Mineral filters which have components like titanium dioxide and zinc oxide. This creates a wall on the skin’s exterior that replicates UV rays off the skin. Some sun protection products consist of both chemical and mineral sun filters.   <br><br>


  If you spend most of the time outdoors, then Sun protection is imperative. It should be applied every morning to help prevent accumulated damage caused by shorter exposure of the sun. There are ample of products available in the Market . It becomes hard for the user which one to opt for. A sunscreen with a good SPF is recommended by Doctors. SPF is a relative measure of how long a sunscreen will protect you from sunburn. If you usually burn after 20 minutes in the sun without sunscreen, an SPF 30 guards for about 10 hours or 600 minutes. Due to variation of wavelength and intensity of UVB rays all through the day and location SPF of the sunscreen may vary. If your skin gets burn after 10min in the sun, then applying an SPF 15 sunscreen would let you to stay in the sun without burning for around 2.5 hours. The calculation of the SPF is done as the amount of time it takes a person's skin to burn when it's shielded in sunscreen linked with when it's not. Sunscreen is effective for up to 2 hours or less if once applied. It recommended to reapply after that or if you sweat more then also. After coming from swimming or toweling or other activities sunscreen should be reapplied. A water-resistant sun shield product will be considered as effective for up to 40 or 80 minutes before it must be reapplied.

            <h4><b>Difference between Cream and Lotion</b></h4><br>
            <p>
              With variety of skin care products available in the market it is hard to differentiate between a Cream and a Lotion. In the hope of looking attractive we forget to nourish our skin and the outcome of this is, it becomes dull after some time. Cream and Lotion both are used for different purposes. Let’s see what makes them different and which one to use when.
 
<br><br>

<span id="dots8">...</span><span id="more8">

  <b>Cream</b><br><br>

  Cream is a 50-50 ration of water and oil . Because of their high oil content, they are very viscous, thick, sometimes stiff and they may leave a greasy feel once applied. Dermatologists suggests that one should use a different face cream and skin cream according to your body type.  Body Cream is to avoid dry and treat cracked skin while keeping it moisturized. One should not use oil-based creams unless they have very dry skin as it could cause acne and other problems. 
Toners have two core purposes 
To prepare skin to look firmer and shrink pores, and 
To bring skin pH back in line after the harsh cleansing method. 
Use appropriate toner once you've washed your face. Put a small amount on a cotton pad and gently apply across your face. Wait until it gets slightly dry, and then apply your favorite moisturizer. Toner removes excess impurities that the cleanser did not take away.  <br><br>

<b>Lotion</b><br><br>

Lotions are mixtures with pointedly less oil. They have high water content. Lotions are easily absorbed by the body and nourishes the skin to its depth. It also heals the dead skin if applied regularly.<br><br>


  Lotions are much more useful in the season of winters when your skin becomes extremely dry and requires deep nourishment for long hours. If your skin is acne-prone you need to use lotions only as they are low in oil content. Make sure to choose a lotion which is free from alcohol. Alcohol along with other chemicals can cause dryness and worsen skin. These alcohol-based products are envisioned to breakdown your skin’s ordinary barriers. Regarding your long-term wellbeing, it’s not a good ingredient to often apply to your face. 
Generally, Lotions are meant to hydrate your skin. If you have a normal or combination skin type, then you should consider using lotions as your daily skincare routine of moisturization.

Lotions are benefitted in both season whether it is summer or winter but its ingredients differ depending on whether. Lotions with SPF according to your skin type is good for sun protection.

It is recommended to use either a cream or a lotion according to your skin type. Both protects the skin from the harsh effects of our environment. 
Person with dry skin should use Cream as they have high oil content which keeps your skin moisturize. For a normal to slightly dry skin type one should use lotion as it leaves less greasy residue.  Lotions are good to use in summers as they provide beautiful skin and rejuvenates dead skin. In the colder weather when your skin becomes extremely dry you should use Creams as they are thicker, creamier, and makes a protective blockade for your skin that remains longer than lotion.
